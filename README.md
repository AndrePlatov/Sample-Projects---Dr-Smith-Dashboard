# Sample Projects - Dr. Smith's Dashboard
DRAFT

Hello! Welcome to Dr. Smith's Dashboard, a sample project for demonstrating my professional skills and knowledge. 
The project consists of a few high level items:
1)	Background story  - a fictional story describing how the project happened from inception all the way through development and concludes on version 2 of the solution.
2)	Documentation – requirements, spec docs, design diagrams and other useful things.
3)	Last, but not the least, - the “solution” itself. 

I hope you will enjoy the time looking through the repository and will find something useful and/or interesting.
